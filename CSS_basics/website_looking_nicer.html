            <h2>History of Animals</h2>
            <p>Animals have existed on Earth for over 600 million years. From the ancient sea creatures of the 
            Cambrian period to the mighty dinosaurs and now to the wide variety of species we see today, 
            animals have evolved into countless forms. Their survival and adaptation offer a fascinating glimpse 
            into the history of life on our planet. Animals are crucial for both ecological balance and human well-being. 
            They play vital roles in ecosystems, providing essential services like pollination, seed dispersal, and 
            maintaining food chains. Additionally, animals contribute to human health and welfare through companionship, 
            assisting individuals with disabilities, and providing food and resources.</p>

            <h2>Why I Love Animals</h2>
            <p>Animals are amazing because of their diversity, intelligence, and ability to connect with humans. 
            Whether it's a loyal dog, a majestic lion, or a curious dolphin, each creature has something unique 
            and beautiful about it. Spending time around animals brings joy and teaches compassion. Many animals 
            are known for their friendly and gentle nature, including dolphins, manatees, capybaras, and dogs. 
            These animals often exhibit affection, peaceful coexistence with other species, and the ability 
            to form long-lasting bonds. Some are also known for their intelligence and willingness to interact 
            with humans.</p>
